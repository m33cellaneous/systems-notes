# Systems Notes
a living collection of notes, diagrams, and reflections developed while studying computer science, software systems, and digital tools.

this is not a set of course summaries or tutorials.  
instead, it captures how my understanding of systems evolves over time--particularly where real-world constraints matter.

## Purpose
the goal:
- clear, written thinking about complex technical systems
- bridge software concepts with design, architecture (actual buildings) and real-world workflows
- practise async documentation and reasoning
- build a durable reference for how I approach problems

Many of these notes are written while learning. They may be incomplete or revised as understanding deepens.

## Structure

repo is loosely organised into the following areas:

- **Foundations**  
  Core ideas such as computation, algorithms, abstraction, and data.

- **Courses**  
  Notes derived from structured learning (e.g. CS50), focused on insights rather than lecture transcription.

- **Systems**  
  Observations about how tools, platforms, and workflows behave at scale.

- **Domain**  
  Connections between software systems and specific professional domains (e.g. architecture, design, construction, tooling).

- **Reflections**  
  Meta-notes on what I am learning, questions that remain open, and how different concepts connect.

The structure may change as the repository grows.

## How to Read This

Each note typically focuses on:
- initial assumptions
- what changed or broke that assumption
- why it matters beyond the classroom
- open questions worth revisiting

This repo is intended to be read selectively, not linearly.

## Status

Active and evolving.
