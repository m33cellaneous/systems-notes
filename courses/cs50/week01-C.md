# Notes on C (CS50)

## Understanding C Programming

i've learned c++ in the past, without knowing the difference with c.  
with my knowledge, it's a traditional programming language that forms the basis of most intensive (resource-heavy) programs.  
my course was somewhat diy; the professor did not explain anything in such clarity as this (nor with examples).  


## Insights Gained

- careful attention to logic and errors
- parameters to be met (correctedness, design, style) // vs company style guide
- emphasise data management and memory usage

most of this, i already knew, but not explicitly described.


## Relevance Beyond Programming

CS50 tools: check50 / design50 / style50  
successful usage of ai to assist in the structure and content of the course where necessary;  
lectures are human-based, providing engaging delivery whilst routine homecheck checks/process can be facilitated with ai-chat.  
doubly beneficial: confirming/clarifying homework errors via ai-chat reduces "shyness" or "embarassment" of being wrong, thus more beneficial to allowing the learner to make mistakes (and LEARN).  
  
why so many places push ai to the forefront of certain tasks (cost-savings), where a human would've performed it to a higher-quality and encourage better engagement  
(ie. ai-generated text/artwork, or client questions)  


## Open Questions

- not so relevant to C, but when and where is ai successfully implemented (in a front-facing role)?
