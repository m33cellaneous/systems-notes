# Week 00 — Scratch

## Initial Reaction
i have a vague memory of Scratch... from hackerspace friends (parents) teaching their kids.

so this is Grasshopper, but without the math..........?


## What Became Clear
on one hand, i am forced to be explicit about control flow and event-logic
on the other hand, i am also forced within the bounds of the existing puzzle pieces, lest i create more complicated functions.

there appears to be language-specific conventions:
- costume vs sprite? (well... NOW i know the difference [state changes])
- where are the messages broadcast?


## thoughts on the interface
**events** vs linear scripts
responses to the same event? (efficiency)
responses to different inputs?
concurrent triggers?

yes, yes, this is all about UI

it is indeed that Scratch makes it difficult to ignore structure, and one cannot accidentally rely on implicit execution order.
variables are explicitly clear and unambiguous...........
for the most part, not necessarily the puzzle pieces. nor the entire UI. 
it obviously has its own esoteric terms, ("backdrop" "costume"), which common sense would be able to interpret that.
common sense is not so common, however....... (thinking about... say.... "do not consume" labels on the side of bleach bottles, for example)

therefore, design flaws are more obvious.

minor annoyance: i would like to add notes in the code, in a tidier way!
Grasshopper makes it easy and clear with labels.


## Connection to Other Domains
- In architecture, 2D plans can abstract reality until 3D (or sectional drawings) exposes conflicts.
- In digital tools, “simple” features mask complex state changes underneath; ie. the button has been clicked, but has the action been performed? 


## Reflection
this is going to be a bit meta but this notes-framework is obviously created by chatgpt, and it's a little cringe.
whatever, let's entertain for a bit...
